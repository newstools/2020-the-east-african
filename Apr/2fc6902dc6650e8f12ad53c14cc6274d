Another change on Friday is we will not kiss the cross. When it is one cross, and several people kiss it, it can easily spread the virus,” Father Niyibizi said.

At the popular Burundi Regina Mundi Cathedral, the priest said communion wafers are now placed on congregants' palms instead of in their mouths. “Priests avoid direct contact with people. Now the congregants stretch out their hands to maintain social distance,” said one of the priests.

But if the government says we suspend all public gatherings, the church will also consider the congregation,” said Father Niyibizi.   For the first time in centuries, Christians cannot meet together physically. The country was about to declare outbreak over
