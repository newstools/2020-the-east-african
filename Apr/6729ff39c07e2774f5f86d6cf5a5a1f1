On May 20, Burundi will hold general elections that combine three polls—the presidential election, legislative elections and district council elections. Burundi on Thursday announced the suspension of the diaspora voting in the general elections set on May 20 over measures against the Covid-19 pandemic in different countries. "The current health situation characterized by the measures imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in different countries doesn't allow the free movement to have access to the chancery," said Burundian foreign minister Ezechiel Nibigira in a correspondence to Burundian diplomatic missions abroad. Nibigira said the electoral body, therefore, regrets of not being able to organize these elections in the face of force majeure. On May 20, Burundi will hold general elections that combine three polls—the presidential election, legislative elections and district council elections.

The continent has seen more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the virus. People who have tested positive for Covid-19 now stands at 246.
