Kenyan politician Martha Karua has welcomed a ruling by the East Africa Court of Justice which awarded her $25,000 (about Ksh2.8 million) for a Supreme Court decision which infringed on her rights to a fair hearing and trial. The Narc Kenya party leader Tuesday said the verdict of the regional court clearly demonstrated that Kenya’s Judiciary did not follow the law when hearing her case against the election of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. “I’m happy that after much struggle in the corridors of the Judiciary, justice has been seen. Justice can't be buried in the sand forever,” she said. Ms Karua said that although she will not get the gubernatorial seat, Kenya's Judiciary had been exposed and the truth of the matter revealed. “What I have been awarded is far much less than what I have spent in the petition but I'm joyous because my supporters and the people of Kenya now know that my case in the Supreme Court was poorly handled and thrown out without facts,” she said. A section of Kirinyaga residents also celebrated after the outcome of Ms Karua’s case at the East African Court of Justice. “It has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the Kenyan Judiciary did not treat Ms Karua's case fairly,” one of the residents, Margaret Wairimu, said. During the hearing of the petition against Ms Waiguru at the Supreme Court, Ms Karua was dealt a major blow when the case was ruled in favour of the governor.
