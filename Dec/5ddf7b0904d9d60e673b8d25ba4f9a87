The United Nations Security Council removed Burundi from its agenda following what it termed an improved security situation in the country. However, opposition leaders accuse the organisation of abandoning them. Opposition leader and chairman of the National Congress for Liberty (CNL) Agathon Rwasa said the move shows the UNSC’s concern is only for safeguarding the interests of the powers that be. “It’s a pity that they say there is improvement of security and human rights while innocent people are held in custody or disappearing,” said Mr Rwasa. “Noting that the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy to Burundi completed his assignment on November 30, 2019, the Security Council requests the Secretary-General to cease his periodic reporting on the situation in Burundi and looks forward to the Secretary-General covering Burundi as part of his regular reporting on the Great Lakes region and Central Africa,” the Security Council said in statement. “Burundi's withdrawal from the UN Agenda allows the country, its friends and partners to focus on development and the well-being of citizens,” said Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye. The ruling party CNDD-FDD praised the Security Council’s move arguing that the organisation and financing of the 2020 general election proved that the country was peaceful and stable. “Burundi could no longer be considered as a threat to international peace and security. On the contrary, Burundi is making a substantial contribution to restoring peace in various conflict-ridden countries through peacekeeping operations,” said Nancy Muto, spokesperson of the ruling party CNDD-FDD. Burundi was hit by political crisis in 2015 that led to almost 1,000 deaths and thousands fleeing to neighbouring countries.
