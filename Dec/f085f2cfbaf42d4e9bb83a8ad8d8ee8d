The Ugandan Electoral Commission (EC) has changed the security detail of National Unity Platform candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, and deployed a new one after the head of the pop star's security team was shot in the face by police. Justice Simon Byabakama, the EC chairperson, confirmed that the head of Very Important Persons Protection Unit, Ms Hadijja Namutebi, had decided to switch the team. “I am not in charge of the security but what I can tell you is that the security detail of Mr Kyagulanyi has been withdrawn because I think they are tired and they don’t have leadership at this time,” he said. This comes just a day after the commander of Bobi Wine's security detail, Mr Wilfred Kato Kubai, was shot by a rubber bullet on the face together with the pop star's right-hand man, Mr Dan Magic. They were taken to Mulago Hospital for further treatment. Sources on Tuesday said that Bobi Wine had contested the decision to change his bodyguards but EC officials insisted that they should be exchanged and a new team take over immediately. “We are aware that they are changing our security team, let us wait and see because we are not the ones in charge. We shall continue to do our work,” Bobi Wine said. “The head of my security which EC gave us was shot at by the police. We believe they were targeting me because the head of security officer, Kato, and one of my producers was also shot,” he added. At the wake of the campaigns when the security was given to Bobi Wine, he rejected them after he was forcibly picked from the nomination centre and taken to his home. Bobi Wine accused them of conniving with other officers to brutalise him.
