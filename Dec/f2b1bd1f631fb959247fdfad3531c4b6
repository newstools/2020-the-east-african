  Nigeria has recorded a sharp increase in deaths from coronavirus. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported that 74 people have died since the beginning of December. Last week, 20 doctors died as a result of the pandemic. Since the onset of the second wave of Covid-19 late last month, critical cases have also increased as states continue to take more stringent measures to stop the spread of the virus. The NCDC reported on December 27, 2020 that there were 22 critical cases of people receiving oxygen at one Federal Capital Territory (FCT) isolation centre. It said that after a progressive drop in the number of deaths recorded from September to November, the death toll rose again this month. The agency also said that 15,949 new positive cases were recorded in December, the highest recorded since the outbreak was reported earlier in the year. President Muhammadu Buhari praised medical workers for their sacrifice in tackling the pandemic and said that the government has prioritized their welfare. He sent his condolences to the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) over the death of the 20 doctors. “The death of our front line health workers in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic is particularly sad because these professionals risk their own lives in order to save others. “Our health workers are making maximum sacrifices for the country in line with their humanitarian calling, and this administration will leave no stone unturned in order to ensure their needs are met,” he said in a statement released on Sunday by his media aide Garba Shehu. The president said that health workers were operating under severe limitations, but are undeterred in discharging their duties in saving lives. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) said it would make a proposal to the Federal Government to train health workers in infection prevention.
