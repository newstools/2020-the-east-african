Fifteen people were killed early Friday morning when the vehicle they were travelling in hit a stationary truck in Mayuge District, eastern Uganda. A woman and a toddler who suffered serious injuries are being treated at Iganga Hospital. The public service vehicle, which had 17 passengers, mostly traders, was headed to Kampala. It hit the truck at 5am at Imanyiro village on Musita-Lumino Road, Busoga East Police Spokesperson James Mubi said. "Sugarcane trucks are not supposed to be parked on the highway because they obstruct other road users, which causes accidents," Mr Mubi added.   The headache set in after release of political detainees, who called for reforms in Kanu.
