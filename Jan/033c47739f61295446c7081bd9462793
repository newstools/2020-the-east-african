Six workers were killed and three others injured after a building under construction collapsed on Wednesday in the Kansanga suburb of the Ugandan capital of Kampala, local police said. The bodies have been retrieved from the debris and the injured taken to hospital, Patrick Onyango, Kampala Metropolitan police spokesperson, told Xinhua by telephone. A committee has been set up to investigate the cause of the collapse, Onyango said. In May 2019, five people, including four children, were killed in a residential fence wall collapse following heavy rains in Kampala. A month later, six street children were killed and two others seriously injured after a school perimeter wall collapsed in the capital.   Govt and Unicef has succeeded in improving the education and health sectors.
