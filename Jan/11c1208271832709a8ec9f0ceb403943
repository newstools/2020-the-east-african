The Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU) on Tuesday announced deregistration of nine universities for failing to take corrective measures aimed at improving the standard of education in their campuses."The deregistered universities have failed to take remedial measures given to them in 2018 to improve the standards of education they offered," said Charles Kihampa, TCU Executive Secretary. He added: "Even if they were given more time they could not have taken the remedial steps." The decision to deregister the universities was taken in a meeting attended by owners of the universities held on January 20, Kihampa told a news conference in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. The deregistered universities included the Archbishop James University College, Cardinal Rugambwa Memorial University College, the Teofilo Kisanji University's Dar es Salaam Center, and the St. John's University's St. Marks Campus. In September 2018, TCU announced deregistration of two private universities for providing substandard academic services. Equally, TCU barred a number of private universities from admitting new students after they had failed to meet required academic standards. TCU said students who were pursuing courses in the two deregistered universities should be shifted to other colleges before the commencement of the 2018/19 academic year.
