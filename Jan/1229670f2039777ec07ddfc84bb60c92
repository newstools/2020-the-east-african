London, Britain on Wednesday condemned Iranian missile attacks on military bases in Iraq that hosted US-led coalition forces including British personnel. “We condemn this attack on Iraqi military bases hosting Coalition - including British - forces,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. “We urge Iran not to repeat these reckless and dangerous attacks, and instead to pursue urgent de-escalation.” Iran fired a volley of missiles on Wednesday at Iraqi bases housing US and other foreign troops, the Islamic republic's first act in its promised revenge for the US killing of a top Iranian general. The missiles targeted the sprawling Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and a base in Arbil, both housing American and other foreign troops deployed as part of a US-led coalition fighting the remnants of the Islamic State group. Iran's supreme leader, who has the final say in all matters of state, said it was a "slap in the face" for the United States but that revenge was yet to come. - Reporting by Reuters and AFP   US Treasury accuses Taban Deng Gai of ordering the deaths of two opposition leaders. climate change is hitting harvests and making life even harder.
