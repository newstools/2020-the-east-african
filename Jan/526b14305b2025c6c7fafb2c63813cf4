Tehran, There is no chance of finding survivors in the wreckage of a Ukranian passenger plane that crashed just outside Iran’s capital Tehran, a non-governmental agency has said. "It is impossible that passengers" on flight PS-752 "are alive," the head of Iran’s Red Crescent told semi-official news agency ISNA. Some 167 passengers and nine crew members were on board the plane when it crashed, state news agency IRNA said, while the Red Crescent put the number at 170 people on board. The Kiev-bound Boeing 737 crashed shortly after take-off in Tehran on Wednesday, according to ISNA.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. WHO called for more funding to combat the disease.
