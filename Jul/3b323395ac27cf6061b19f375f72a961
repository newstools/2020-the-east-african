The deadline for submissions in the “This Is Uganda Short Film Competition” has been extended to August 30, 2020. The initial deadline for the inaugural edition was April 15, which was disrupted by the lockdown and restrictions occasioned by the rampaging Covid-10 pandemic. The new deadline was announced by the Ugandan-American Hollywood actor Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine in a WhatsApp video. “We are all struggling to deal with the new normal of living in the time of Covid-19. I know some of you were in the middle of filming when the lockdown and government restrictions were imposed throwing a wrench in your filming,” says, Ntare, who is the artist and project creator of the competition. “I am hoping now that since some the restrictions have been lifted in Uganda you will find a safe and creative way to complete your films. Or create new work for the new deadline,” he added. The cash prize still stands at $5,000 for Best Short Film, $5,000 for Best Female Director, and $1,600 for Runner-Up prizes. Films submitted for competition need to be made in Uganda by Ugandans. Filmmakers are required to make five-minute or less short films on the theme "This is Uganda". They can create any story that takes place in Uganda. This could be an experimental, dramatic, comic, or a documentary short film. Films can be in any Ugandan language, in Kiswahili, English or a combination. Multiple entries are permitted. “I have received a number of film submissions already and there is no clear front runner yet. So, if you haven’t submitted your film the prize is still for the taking. For those who have submitted your film, congratulations on being one step ahead. And the piece of advice I would give to all of you is to remember that simplicity is a virtue,” Ntare said.
