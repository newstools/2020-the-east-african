Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday announced phased reopening of the country as the government moved to relax Covid-19 restrictions. The president said cessation of movement into and out of the capital Nairobi, and Mombasa and Mandera counties would lapse on Tuesday 4am. He, however, extended the nationwide 9pm-4am curfew for 30 days. "We shall review interactions for 21 days and if they spike, we will lock down [the country]," Mr Kenyatta said. The president also allowed reopening of places of worship, restricting them to one-hour services and no more than 100 people at a time. Places of worship will be required to strictly adhere to safety protocols in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. Sunday Schools and Madrassas will, however, remain closed. No congregants under 13 years or over 58 years should be allowed in places of worship, Mr Kenyatta added. Those with underlying health conditions have also been cautioned against congregating to worship. The president urged Kenyans to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety measures to prevent spread of the disease. "It is your duty and good will to defend and protect yourself and family and environment...Minimise unnecessary movements, delay upcountry travel, adhere to protocols," he added.   They were stranded in Uganda for 3 months due to Covid-19 suspension of flights.
