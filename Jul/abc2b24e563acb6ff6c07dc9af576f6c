Lusaka Zambia's Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya, who is facing corruption charges, appeared in court on Thursday. Dr Chilufya was before the Lusaka Magistrate Court to face four counts of corruption, but could not take plea due to fracas caused by his supporters who turned up in their numbers. Chief Resident Magistrate Lameck Mwale adjourned as the unruly supporters tried to force their way into the courtroom to show solidarity with him, State radio reported. He was escorted to court by chiefs from Luapula Province, a region bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo where he hails. His supporters claim Dr Chilufya is being targeted because of his presidential ambitions. Prosecutors, however, say the minister is in possession of property suspected to be proceeds of crime. These include 6,000 shares in Samfya Marines and Tourism Services Limited, Spark GuestHouse situated in Mansa, among others. He was charged on June 24 after an investigation by the Anti-Corruption Commission. His case was adjourned to July 16, 2020. President Edgar Lungu has been under pressure from the opposition to suspend or fire Dr Chilufya in light of the ongoing court process. However, Mr Lungu says his minister is presumed innocent until the court finds otherwise.
