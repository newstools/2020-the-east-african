The Kenyan government has extended operating hours for restaurants to 7.30pm. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe made the announcement Tuesday during the daily coronavirus briefing. He emphasised that bars remain closed. Mr Kagwe said eateries, among other guidelines, must check the temperatures of customers coming to the eateries and restrict access to those with fever symptoms. Restaurants are also required to place tables at least 1.5 metres apart and limit the number of patrons per table to four per 10 square metres. Further, the measures require that all workers at the facilities be tested for Covid-19 to reduce the risk of waiters spreading the disease.   Locals are hosting them in their homes.
