Facebook has launched a free programme designed to meet digital literacy needs across Africa in a bid to increase awareness on responsible online behaviour on its platforms. Dubbed My Digital World the platform, a fusion of all Facebook digital literacy programmes, is tailored to equip participants across sub-Saharan Africa with skills needed to navigate the digital world. My Digital World in partnership with iEARN Kenya, will support teachers by providing virtual sessions with the aim of equipping them with knowledge, skills and competencies necessary to guide their learners on how to navigate the digital world responsibly and safely. Facebook said in a press release that it was preparing to train close to 20,000 participants across Kenya, Ethiopia, Zambia, Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire on safe, responsible and beneficial usage of the digital platforms. “We remain committed to equipping young people and the general public across sub-Saharan Africa with the vital digital skills needed to navigate the digital world, especially during these challenging times of Covid-19,” said policy programmes manager for Economic Impact and Digital Literacy, Facebook, Phil Oduor. The e-learning platform will feature Safe Online with Facebook, a 12-week after school workshop designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of online safety; Ilizwe Lam a secondary school programme that offers news literacy and digital citizenship skills and eZibo offers training around responsible social media usage. The training has been rolled out in line with Facebook’s efforts to reduce cases of abuse, bullying and trolling of its platforms and ensure the safe well-being of individuals and communities visiting its platforms. Facebook has instituted policies, tools, programmes etc to enable safe use of its platforms.   Some 41 people recovered and two others died in the last 24 hours.
