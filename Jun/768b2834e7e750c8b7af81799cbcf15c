Abuja, At least 99 people were killed Tuesday by bandits in Borno and Katsina states, in northern Nigeria. Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum on Wednesday confirmed that 81 people were killed in Faduma Koloram village, in Gubio local government area of state. Thirteen others were injured as they tried to flee the attackers, he added. Mr Zulum said the bandits could be the same ones who attacked Gajiram local government area some months ago. He said peace will only be realised if the insurgents are dealt with and defeated. “That requires a lot of support from the government,” the governor added. Mr Gambo Isah, spokesman of the Police Command in Katsina State, on Wednesday also confirmed that 18 people in Kadisau, Faskari Local Government Area of the state, were killed on Tuesday. Twenty-six others were injured as they tried to repulse the attackers. He said more than 200 bandits attacked Kadisau village and stole food. “The bandits faced serious confrontation from some people of the area…they [the attackers] started shooting, killing 18 people on the spot,” Mr Isah said. Meanwhile, the Federal Government has condoled with the families of the victims. Ms Sadiya Umar-Faruk, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Human Development, said, “The Federal Government under President Muhammadu will not relent in its efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of the evil act are brought to book.” Since May 14, after the military launched Operation Katsina to fight militants, soldiers have killed 392 bandits in the area.   Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by flooding. Ambassador Yukwan, 64, is survived by two widows and 11 children.
