A major exhibition is being planned to celebrate the work of Sidney Mang’ong’o, a rising star of the art world who stood on the cusp of international recognition. Including his most recent work, it will be held at the Circle Art Gallery in Nairobi later this year — but tragically the artist will not be there to enjoy his latest success. For Mang’ong’o succumbed to the inner demons that had haunted him for many years and took his own life at his home in Matasia, Nairobi, at the end of last month. He was aged 37 and is survived by his mother and a brother. His is a further loss to the art community and follows the passing of Ashif Malamba of the Maasai Mbili collective in 2015, Omosh Kindeh of the Kuona Trust Art Centre the following year and of Ngene Mwaura, also of the Kuona in December last year. Poignantly Mang’ong’o visited both the Maasai Mbili and Kuona studios the night before he died. Paying tribute to him, Danda Jaroljmek a Circle director, commented “He was an exceptionally talented painter and had developed a following of collectors. He was always on his own path, uninfluenced by artistic trends.” Jaroljmek had encouraged and promoted his work for some 15 years, from his early figurative paintings to his recent abstracts that captured the internal planes and voids of the new concrete towers being built throughout the region. They last met just two days before Mang’ong’o died, when they discussed plans for a second solo exhibition and the hope that he would be able to travel to take up residencies to widen his experiences and expand his practice. Of the planned exhibition Jaroljmek said: “It shall stand as a tribute to a lovely man, a remarkable artist and a dear friend who will be sorely missed.”   The funding will go towards helping Kenyans at risk of hunger. More than 136,000 new cases were reported worldwide on Sunday.
