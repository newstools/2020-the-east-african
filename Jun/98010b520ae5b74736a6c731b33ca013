Rabat, King Mohammed VI of Morocco had successful heart surgery on Sunday in Rabat, state news agency MAP said. The King was treated for a heart rhythm disorder known as “atrial flutter”, it said. The 56-year-old King underwent a similar surgery to normalise his heart rhythm two years ago in Paris. King Mohammed VI has headed the Muslim world’s longest-serving dynasty since 1999, when his father Hassan II died. Morocco is a constitutional monarchy where the King holds sweeping powers.   Thirty-three more patients have recovered. Govts have agreed to maintain a 35pc import duty rate to protect local manufacturers.
