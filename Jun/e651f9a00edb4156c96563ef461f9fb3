The Covid-19 pandemic has cut off tourists disrupting the sector across the world. Countries are now looking for ways to keep travellers engaged as they await the reopening of borders. Last week, Kenya’s Ministry of Tourism through the Kenya Tourism Board launched a six-week virtual safari. “Our international tourism business is completely cut off and we have to still share destination memories with travellers. We are unveiling a virtual tour safari to connect visitors with the destination,” said Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala in a statement. Betty Radier, the CEO of Kenya Tourism Board (KTB), said the strategy is tailored to the current circumstances. “We have seen an opportunity where people are online, looking and thinking of places they can go to. That is a great opportunity for us to showcase the destination live. So, we have begun the project to 16 different destinations. We will be showcasing wildlife, beach, conservation and community that will give people a taste of what awaits them once we reopen for business. “This venture begins at the Nairobi National Park and will document our diverse wildlife in parks and game reserves, thrilling adventures, beautiful lodges, unique cultures and conservation projects. We shall be live streaming and sharing this content every week,” Balala said.   97 patients have been discharged from health facilities in the last 24 hours. 15 people have recovered, including First VP Machar and his wife.
