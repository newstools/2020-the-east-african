Kenya's Covid-19 cases continued to rise after 121 more people tested positive for the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 3,215. The government had tested 3,291 samples, Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Mutahi Kagwe in a statement on Thursday. He said 44 more people were discharged from hospitals bringing total recoveries to 1,092. Deaths, however, increased to 92 after three more patients succumbed to the virus overnight, he added. On Wednesday, Kenya’s Health ministry rolled out home care guidelines for Covid-19 patients. Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Rashid Aman said it was becoming untenable to isolate all Covid-19 cases in hospitals. Dr Aman said 78 percent of positive cases in Kenya are asymptomatic and some can be managed at home.   Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by flooding. Ambassador Yukwan, 64, is survived by two widows and 11 children.
