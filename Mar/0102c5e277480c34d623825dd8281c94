Five artists Gaël Maski (DR Congo), Canon Griffin (Uganda), Maliza Kiasuwa (Kenya), Eria ‘Sane’ Nsubuga (Uganda), Letaru Dralega (Uganda), and Adonias Ekuwe Ocom (Uganda) are holding an exhibition on the different ways of making collages. In the exhibition titled Collage Broadly Defined, the artists demonstrate the art form as a process. The exhibition, which opened at the Afriart Gallery in Industrial Area, Kampala on March 20, will run until May 16. In his mixed media coloured paintings Saint Cutex, Saint Kibala owa New Taxi Park, and Saint Gadigadi owa Namayiba, Ocom uses chaos as a backdrop. Ocom says Saint Kibala owa New Taxi Park is about the undaunted spirits of the women who sell fruits and vegetables on the streets of Kampala. In Griffin’s works titled Everything is Here Every Time, All These Travelers, Worlds in a World Yesterday Made Today (Universal Coherence), and Eclipse of Time, he draws us into a space of recollection. In his works 2-Personal Transitions, 8-Personal Transitions Series, 13-Personal Transitions Series, 11-Personal Transitions Series and Touch, Maski builds a bridge between dreams that exist as an oasis to societal realities in ecological, psychological, and physical spheres. Dralega constructs an imagined past on colonial history through his paintings Those who Follow, A Wide Sargasso Sea, and Swahili Girls/My Sisters Keeper. Nsubuga focuses on the accidental nature of collage and looks at borders in his video installations Uganda Airlines—I’m not your Servant and Uganda Airlines—Citizens of Every. In her paintings Today is Yesterday Part 1 and Today is Yesterday, Kiasuwa reveals the struggle for visibility in a shared space. “The vocabulary, form and course of collage are explored, inviting an intimate reading of the medium,” said exhibition curator Sarah Bushra.
