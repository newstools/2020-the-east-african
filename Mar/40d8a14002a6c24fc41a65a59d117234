Chief Justice David Maraga told a press briefing that court activities will be reduced for two weeks effective Monday. CJ Maraga said prisoners and remandees will not be presented to court for the two weeks, and urged staff to limit travel.   President Kenyatta calls for National Day of Prayer amid virus outbreak.
