In Uganda, the number of HNWI declined by six per cent to 137 in 2019 from 146 in 2018 while the number of UHNWIs remained unchanged at five individuals. The report notes that the population of UHNWI in Tanzania will grow by 54 per cent over the next five years while that of Uganda and Kenya will grow by 20 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. In Africa, the number of HNWI rose four per cent to 302,360 from 290,396 over the period under review while UHNWIs rose by two per cent to 4,501 from 4,428.
