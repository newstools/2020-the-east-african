Gen Jamal is said to have been in the neighbouring South Sudan for more than a week purposely engaged in Sudanese Peace talks mediated by President Kiir, with some of the rebel groups Khartoum wants to bring to the fold of the transitional government under Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. He was a member of the Sovereign Council that took power under a 39-month power-sharing deal between the military and civilian groups after the toppling of former President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The minister passed on at Pyramid Continental hotel, where he had been staying. It’s however not yet clear what caused his death.   One of the victims is an 8-month-old baby whose father travelled from Kenya recently. Bid to stop the potential spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
