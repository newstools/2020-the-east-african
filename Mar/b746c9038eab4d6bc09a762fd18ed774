 Cameroonian afro-jazz icon Manu Dibango has died from coronavirus (Covid-19), his family has said. The family made the announcement in a statement posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday. “It is with deep sadness that we announce the loss of Manu Dibango, our Papy Groove, who died from Covid-19 on March 24, 2020, aged 86.” “His funeral service will be held in strict privacy, and a tribute to his memory will be organised when possible,” read the statement posted in French. The saxophonist, songwriter and singer was on Wednesday last week admitted in a French hospital for a different disease when he contracted the virus, his aides said at the time. The government is yet to issue official statement on the demise of the jazz maestro. Dibango's hit song Soul Makossa—produced in 1972—is said to have influenced Michael Jackson's 'Wanna Be Starting Somethin’ which was the opening track of the American's famous album Thriller of 1982.   The masks went missing at a Kenyan airport at the end of last week. Analysts reckon that foreign investors have been net sellers in the past three weeks.
