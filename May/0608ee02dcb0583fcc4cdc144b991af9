The US military held a high ranking virtual meeting on May 6 with Rwandan and Kenyan officials, “to discuss air operations in Africa and lessons learnt as we continue to fight through the Covid-19 pandemic,” according to a dispatch from the US-Africa Command. The dispatch said the pandemic had forced even the military to adhere to health guidelines to mitigate its spread. Gen Jeff Harrigian, commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa, held separate virtual meetings with Rwanda’s Maj-Gen Emmanuel Bayingana and Maj-gen Francis O Ogolla of Kenya. The meetings came in the backdrop of the downing of a Kenyan-registered cargo plane last week in the southern town of Bardale in Somalia. The plane was delivering medical supplies. Kenya and Somalia said they will jointly investigate the crash that killed six people. The aircraft was hit as it descended into the local airstrip. Somalia’s President Mohamed Farmaajo told Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta that the matter will be fully investigated. Relations between the two countries have been lukewarm for almost a year over a maritime boundary dispute. The investigations may rope in Ethiopia as the airstrip is also a military base for Ethiopian Amisom troops. Addis Ababa on Tuesday labelled the incident as a “accident” but said it will leave the matter to “competent authorities” in Somalia to investigate.   Kenya reports a total of 649 cases, 207 recoveries and 30 deaths. Efforts include trimming of non-core expenditures such as travel and trainings.
