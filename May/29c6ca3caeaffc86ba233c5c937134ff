It was unclear how long the border will remain shut. Zambia's President Edgar Lungu last week announced the reopening of some sectors of the economy like casinos and gyms which were shut on March 18, saying the economy is taking a hit due to lack of activity. He said the companies ought to find a way of operating under the new normal as they observe measures meant to slow down the spread of the virus. So far, the country has recorded 267 positive cases, 117 recoveries and seven deaths. Nakonde is among Zambia’s largest border posts, acting as a gateway to East Africa.
