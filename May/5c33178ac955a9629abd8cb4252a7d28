Uganda has reported 84 new cases of Covid-19, the highest number registered in a single day since the first case was confirmed in the East African country in March this year. The Ministry of Health on Sunday morning said the countryâ€™s total number of confirmed cases had risen to 413. Of these, 52 cases are truck drivers, 50 of whom arrived from South Sudan via Elegu, while two arrived from Kenya through Busia. CONTACTS Additionally, 32 cases are contacts of previously confirmed cases. "All were under quarantine at the time of testing," said a statement posted on the ministry's social media platforms. At the same time, 51 foreign truck drivers who tested positive at points of entry were denied entry and handed over to their country of origin. So far, 72 people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals across the country. The total number of people tested on Saturday was 1,835. Recently, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health Diana Atwine expressed concern that the community contacts of the truck drivers might be spreading the disease because some of them are yet to be traced. LOCKDOWN The spread of the disease among communities during such a time when the Ugandan government is starting to ease the lockdown could cause a spike in the number of cases confirmed. President Yoweri Museveni is on Monday June 1 expected to give further guidance regarding Covid-19 and the way forward. In his previous televised addresses, Mr Museveni said wearing a facemask would be made compulsory for everyone aged six years and above as the country moves to ease the virus lockdown.   Of the five VPs, only two have not tested positive for coronavirus.
