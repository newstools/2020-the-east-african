• Judge Raphael Yanyi was pronounced dead Wednesday morning on arrival at a hospital in the capital Kinshasa after he fell ill at his home at around 2am, police confirmed. A Congolese judge handling the graft case against Vital Kamerhe, former top aide to President Felix Tshisekedi, has died. Judge Raphael Yanyi was pronounced dead Wednesday morning on arrival at a hospital in the capital Kinshasa after he fell ill at his home at around 2am, police confirmed. "The judge was a victim of a heart attack. He was not murdered, he was protected by the police, " Kinshasa police chief Sylvano Kasongo said. Shortly after the announcement, residents staged a protest outside the judge’s residence alleging foul play. A day before his death, Judge Yanyi had directed the public hearing of Kamerhe’s trial in $50 million graft case. It was not immediately clear what will happen at trial following Yanyi’s death. Kamerhe, once a close ally of Tshisekedi, is accused of embezzling the funds allocated to public works during Tshisekedi’s first 100 days in office. Kamerhe denies the charges.   "I have not killed any Tutsis. I was working with them," Felicien Kabuga to a French court. This is so far the highest daily increase in the country.
