Mr Makuei told The East African on Wednesday night that he and several of his colleagues who sat on the initial High-Level Taskforce on Covid-19 had tested positive for the viral disease. “I have decided to isolate myself from the public,” he said on the phone. “Since I tested positive, there is no need to hide it from the public because this is one way of protecting others. I also advise people not to visit me for now, but [to] communicate on phone whenever necessary for I don’t want to be a carrier spreading the virus.” The Minister for Cabinet Affairs, Elia Lomuro, one of the members of the defunct taskforce, said in a statement that he tested negative for the virus. On Wednesday, South Sudan confirmed 134 new Covid-19 cases, bring the country’s tally to 481. It has also recorded four deaths and four recoveries so far.
