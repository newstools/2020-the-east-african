Angola currently has 22 active cases, 11 recoveries and two fatalities, Minister Silvia Lutukuta said, adding that 908 people were in institutional quarantine. “Angola is on the verge of community spread of the virus and there is a need for increased preventive measures,” she added. Angola recorded its first two cases of the coronavirus on March 21, with the two people having come from Portugal.

It began on March 27 and was to end on April 10 but it has been extended twice -- first to April 25 and to May 10. Meanwhile, Mozambique on Saturday announced eight more recoveries from the coronavirus, bringing the total of recoveries to 18. The country has a total of 79 confirmed cases with 61 active ones, public health national director Rosa Marlene announced. Mozambique confirmed its first positive case of coronavirus on March 28 from a 75-year-old citizen who arrived from the UK.   Countries like Gambia spend up to nine times on debt payments than on funding health services. Close proximity of people at rallies has sparked concerns that virus infections could spike.
