With millions of birders creating countless bird lists, some tech-savvy birders at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in the US thought that if all these lists were put on one platform it would not only transform birding but contribute to science. And hence the creation of eBird, a free online database providing scientists and researchers with real-time data about bird distribution and abundance, which can inform conservation strategies.
