Days after the confirmation, President Salva Kiir imposed restrictions including ban on all public gatherings, closure of all learning institutions, and enforcement of curfew, among other measures to prevent further spread. Last week, different South Sudanese stakeholders criticised President Kiir for lifting Covid-19 cases, warning that country may experience a full blown out of the pandemic.
