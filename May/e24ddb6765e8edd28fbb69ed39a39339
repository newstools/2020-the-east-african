Members of the Safaricom Youth Orchestra will get their music lessons through e-learning using 4G-enabled mobile handsets from Safaricom. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the physical practice sessions. But, the over 80 students who make up the orchestra will now receive music instructions from home. “We acknowledge the significant role that music plays in our daily lives, more so to the 10 to 17-year-old boys and girls who get the chance to play for the Safaricom Youth Orchestra. We aim to bridge the divide brought about by the restriction of movement by enabling the students to get access to their music tutors through e-learning,” said Peter Ndegwa, chief executive officer, Safaricom. The orchestra draws together 45 per cent of its students from public schools, 30 per cent from the Ghetto Classics programme, and 25 per cent from private schools with the aim of providing Kenya’s next generation of professional musicians. “Interaction among students and with their music tutors goes a long way in shaping who they are. Not only are the students equipped with musical knowledge but personal development and leadership skills,” said Elizabeth Njoroge, Safaricom Youth Orchestra manager. Started in 2014, the orchestra has seen 120 of its members graduate from its programme. Safaricom has also partnered with Eneza Education, Longhorn Publishers and Viusasa to provide free access to educational content for primary and secondary school students studying from home.   The pandemic has spread across all 54 African countries. Algeria's coronavirus outbreak is one of the worst in Africa.
