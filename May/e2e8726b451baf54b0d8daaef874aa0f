Somalia's confirmed Covid-19 cases crossed the 1,000 mark over the weekend as the country continues to record an alarming spike in positive results. Coronavirus cases rose by 57 on Sunday and on Monday rose by 35 to now stand at a total of 1,089. On Sunday, Minister for Health Dr Fawzia Abikar Nur announced that the positive cases were recorded in Mogadishu and surrounding areas, the semiautonomous state of Puntland and Somaliland. While Puntland is a member state of the federal government of Somalia, Somaliland in the northwest unilaterally declared cessation from the rest of Somalia in May 1991. Covid-19 deaths have also risen to 52 while 121 people have recovered. Meanwhile, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Health on Covid-19, Dr Mohamed Mohamoud Fuje, said on Monday that Somalia ranks 13th among African countries affected by coronavirus. He called the situation very frightening, and advised Somalis to abide by all state advice.   Uganda has carried out thousands of tests on truck drivers with 51 found positive for the virus. On March 24, South Sudan closed all airports and border crossings in a bid to contain virus.
