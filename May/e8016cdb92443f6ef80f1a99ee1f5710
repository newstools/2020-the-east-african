An international initiative to create a new big five (#NewBig5) of wildlife has been set up. It is about photography, not hunting; shooting with a camera, not a gun. The project is supported by more than a hundred leading photographers, conservationists and wildlife lovers. It includes primatologist Jane Goodall who pioneered chimpanzee research and photojournalist Ami Vitale who shot the iconic image of Sudan, the last northern white rhino in his dying days, with his carer, ranger James Mwenda at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. "Any project that brings attention to animals, so many of whom are threatened or endangered, is truly important," said Dr Goodall. "This is a celebration of wildlife and wildlife photography," said Graeme Greene, the wildlife photographer and journalist and founder of the project.   Felicien Kabuga was detained in a Paris suburb on Saturday after a quarter century on the run. Kenya records 66 new coronavirus cases, the highest single-day jump, raising the tally to 1,029.
