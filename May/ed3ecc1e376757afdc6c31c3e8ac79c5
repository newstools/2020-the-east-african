EASE LOCKDOWN Despite the rapid spread of the pandemic, the country is preparing to ease the lockdown from level four to level three, starting from June 1. Level three will allow 8 million people to return to work with the resumption of most of the economic sector. Also on Wednesday, the country's Ministry of Health warned that harsher lockdown restrictions could be re-introduced at Covid-19 hotspots in the country if interventions fail to contain the pandemic in these areas after June 1. Hotspots are areas that have more than five infected people per 100,000 population, or areas where the infections are increasing at a fast pace. Some major metropolitan municipalities such as Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and the Nelson Mandela Bay have been identified as hotspots.   Governors Emmanuel Gasana and Gatabazi Jean Marie Vianney pushed out pending probe. Abdelbagi is the fifth senior government official to get the virus.
