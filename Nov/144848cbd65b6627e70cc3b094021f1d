Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi is scheduled to visit South Sudan on Saturday for bilateral talks with President Salva Kiir, according to South Sudan’s Presidential Press Secretary. “President Kiir will welcome his Egyptian counterpart President Abdel Al-Sisi upon arrival at Juba International Airport tomorrow (Saturday). “The two counterparts are expected to hold bilateral talks, which will include State Lunch. They will discuss bilateral issues and exchange views on regional stability as well as deepening South Sudan’s and Egypt's diplomatic ties,” Ms Ateny Wek Ateny told The EastAfrican on Friday. Egypt has for a long time assisted South Sudan, donating food and medical supplies to peace soldiers at cantonment sites in support of the revitalized peace agreement. Rajab Mohandis, who heads the Organization for Responsive Governance, a civic education and human rights advocacy organisation, urged President Kiir to use the opportunity to advance support for the 2018 peace deal. “It would be appropriate for the President to share with his counterpart the progress of the peace agreement and areas of need, which would require support and collaboration with Egypt,” he said. The president should also discuss the safety of South Sudanese refugees and residents in Egypt, “given the rising concerns regarding our citizens being attacked there and facing a lot of problems in different ways that jeopardise their security,” Mr Mohandis added.
