Tanzania’s National Election Commission (NEC) has defended the process and results of the October 28 General Election, saying they were free and fair. Opposition parties claim that the polls were marred with irregularities. Director of Elections Wilson Mahera said in a statement on Tuesday, “The commission has observed with serious concern a widening attempt by some actors both locally and internationally to paint Tanzania’s 2020 election results to be anything but free and fair. “The 2020 elections have adhered to all local and international laws, principles and guidelines for holding democratic elections and therefore stands by the final election outcome as announced. “Also, NEC welcomes reports and conclusion of regional, international and independent election observer missions that have endorsed the final outcome of the 2020 elections. The commission will equally work on all areas where legitimate matters of concern have been raised so as to improve the conduct of the democratic elections in Tanzania in the future”. Mr Mahera added that parties rejecting the official final results do not have any legitimate grounds to do so as all registered political parties fully participated by fielding candidates for presidential, parliamentary and ward seats both on the mainland and in Zanzibar. “NEC registered 1,257 candidates from various political parties competing for parliamentary seats nationwide, 93 percent of these party observers signed the exit poll sheets, and NEC can provide evidence to any interested party that wishes to validate the same,” he said. Mr Mahera said the Tanzanian justice system has legal mechanisms through which either individual candidates or political parties can challenge the election results. NEC is mandated to investigate any complaints of election malpractice, he added.
