Though we still come to office, most of our meetings are held virtually needing less printed documents. Some services have been outsourced to the Nairobi office reduced the workload on our side. We have digitised almost 90 per cent of our operations to date, but the idea of shared work platform that interconnects us and our service providers is not feasible because some players have divergent digitisation benchmarks in their systems. We have experienced less austerity pressures during lockdown because we run a lean operation,” said Mubbale Kabandamawa Mugalya, Investment Manager at Sanlam Investments East Africa Ltd, a pension scheme and unit trust fund manager. “Equity markets are likely to come under pressure from muted participation by domestic and offshore investors due to the economic uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.
