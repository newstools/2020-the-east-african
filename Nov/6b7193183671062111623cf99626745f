There have been wrangles within the coalition. The singer is a public supporter of former President Joseph Kabila and his party, the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD). n her song, Tshala Muana sings about a man who becomes successful after benefitting from his mentor.Supporters of President Tshisekedi, currently at odds with Joseph Kabila's camp, believe the song is addressed to President Tshisekedi. Tshisekedi’s supporters threatened the artiste over the song. The government did not state the reason for the Tshala Muana’s detention but her song has since been banned and local radio stations warned against playing it.
