Safaricom is seeking to offer services in the education, agriculture and health sectors as it uses technology to expand its business. The telco, which marked its 20th anniversary in October, has seen exponential growth and now is looking to innovation to simplify its products and services in line with its future strategy. The chief executive Peter Ndegwa said the company will continue to be purpose-led as it transforms into a technology company. Safaricom has since grown to become the leading telco in the country, with 65 percent of the market share under its grip. “We started as a mobile company, we have evolved and combined technology and innovation to really transform lives. We want to be a purpose-led technology company but the foundation of that is to be customer-obsessed,” said Mr Ndegwa. DATA-DRIVEN ECONOMY The CEO said the company will improve more on transparency especially on data to customers, an area he acknowledged has been problematic. He added that the company is cognizant of the fact that technology and a data-driven economy can further support Kenya’s economic growth and that will be the company’s launchpad for the next 20 years. “We plan to go beyond to new frontiers, be more present, more world-class, and enable new platforms that would help to launch our small and micro-enterprises to greater possibilities,” said Mr Ndegwa. To cater for increasing demand for mobile money to small micro-enterprises, the company unveiled “Pochi la Biashara” (business wallet), a product targeting small business owners such as food vendors and boda boda riders to separate personal transactions from business transactions and keep track of their earnings. The product is accessed by merely dialling a short code, by passing the mobile app, meaning even users of feature phones that cannot access the apps can use it. To celebrate two decades of operations, Safaricom launched the “Twende Tukiuke,” (Let’s Go Beyond) campaign.
