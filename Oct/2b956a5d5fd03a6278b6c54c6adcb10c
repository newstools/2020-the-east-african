Tanzania’s Inspector General of Police (IGP) Simon Sirro has confirmed that 42 people are in police custody in Pemba, the minor island in the archipelago of Zanzibar for engaging in violence and general social disturbance ahead of the general election scheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday, October 28. "When the police were distributing ballot boxes, a group of youth started throwing stones at them but they were eventually arrested. About 42 of them. So far there has been no death," said IGP Sirro. He was addressing the media in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, on preparations for the elections. The ballot boxes were for early voting for election and security officials as per the new rules of the Zanzibar Electoral Commission and National Electoral Commission. The IGP said the election process is expected to go peacefully and called on citizens to refrain from causing tensions and unrest of any kind. "We are prepared to ensure there is no breach of the peace. Tomorrow morning ( October 28) if you are one of the voters go and vote then go home,” he said. He asked politicians to refrain from mobilising the public to gather at polling stations in the guise of ‘’protecting the vote,’’ saying they will face the force of the law. "Each political party has its agent present so there is no need to mobilise people.”
