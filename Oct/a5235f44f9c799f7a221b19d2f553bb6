 The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) officers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) have seized concealed heroin and bhang being smuggled through an international courier service provider. KRA said on Wednesday that heroin was on transit from Juba in South Sudan to Cambodia, while bhang was from Kasese in Uganda and destined for France. The illegal drugs were detected by the non-intrusive scanners at the airport. “KRA Customs officers jointly with other officers from the multiagency team at JKIA opened the consignments for 100 percent verification after the scanner showed some concealments,” KRA stated. “Heroin was concealed in the buttons of dresses in the consignment, while the bhang was wrapped in a black polythene paper concealed in an inner pocket of a kitenge cloth,” the taxman said. The authority said both consignments were seized separately and placed in the custody of the anti-narcotics unit. It did not, however, indicate when the drugs were found, only stating that it was recently. The value of the banned drugs was undisclosed.
