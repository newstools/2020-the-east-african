The suspects were arrested in Mwakitau along the Taveta-Mombasa highway by Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) officers from the Taveta-Holili one-stop border point (OSBP) on Friday. “The KRA team, backed by Administration Police officers attached to the OSBP, while on routine patrols intercepted the devices while being transported together with tobacco by a truck no.
